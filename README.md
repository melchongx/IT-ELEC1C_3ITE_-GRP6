# InnoNet Forum
From the name itself “Inno” (a shortened word for Innovative) which means the ability to come up with new ideas, methods, products, or solutions that differ from established norms or conventional practices. Since our website focuses on the users showcasing their new ideas and talking about their opinions when it comes to the specific field of technology they are interested in, we came up with the title InnoNet because they’re both connected with our website.
